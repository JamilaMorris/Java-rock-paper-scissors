# Java-rock-paper-scissors
This project is a Java console game where a user plays Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. The computer randomly selects a choice, and the program determines the winner based on standard game rules.

How it works
The program prompts the user to enter rock, paper, or scissors. The computer generates a random choice, and conditional statements compare both choices to decide the outcome. After each round, the user is asked if they want to play again.

How to run
Compile and run the program using the terminal:
